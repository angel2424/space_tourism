## Project Description

This project is a personal undertaking of a Frontend Mentor and Kevin Powell Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to implement a given design concept using React JS. I downloaded the design files for this project and, although Kevin Powell has provided a comprehensive tutorial on building the project, I have chosen to take on the challenge independently. Through utilizing my own understanding of React JS and Google, I was able to successfully build the project. This project was a great opportunity for me to improve my skills in React JS and to gain a sense of accomplishment by successfully completing the challenge.
